    # The layout section defines what components gitmux shows and the order in
    # which they appear on tmux status bar.
    #
    # Allowed components:
    #  - branch:            local branch name. Examples: `⎇ main`, `⎇ :345e7a0` or `[rebase]`
    #  - remote-branch:     remote branch name, for example: `origin/main`.
    #  - divergence:        divergence between local and remote branch, if any. Example: `↓·2↑·1`
    #  - remote:            alias for `remote-branch` followed by `divergence`, for example: `origin/main ↓·2↑·1`
    #  - flags:             symbols representing the working tree state, for example `✚ 1 ⚑ 1 … 2`
    #  - stats:             insertions/deletions (lines), for example`Σ56 Δ21`
    #  - some string `foo`: any other character of string is directly shown, for example `foo` or `|`
